# Jav Scraper Package

**A Jav (Japanese Adult Video) Scraper that collects and summarizes metadata from multiple websites**

By grabbing the bangou in the file name, JavSP can pull data from multiple websites and summarize them, classify them according to a predefined rule and create metadata for softwares like Emby, Jellyfin and Kodi.

**Docker & WebUI**: Due to limited spare time, there's no Docker support yet. Additionally, a GUI is not [the focus of this project](https://github.com/Yuukiy/JavSP/issues/148). If you need Docker support, maybe you can give [JavSP-Docker](https://github.com/tetato/JavSP-Docker) a try.

**i18n**: This project currently supports only Chinese. [Vote here](https://github.com/Yuukiy/JavSP/discussions/157) for i18n support.
